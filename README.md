# PdfTools  
  
**Open-source pdf tools built for windows(not only 10, for 8 and older versions).**  
  
## Description  
  
Adobe Acrobat is very widely used PDF program. However, free version of it(Adobe Reader DC) only supports reading of PDF files,
so if one need to merge or extract some pages or do other things, he/she have to use Pro version(Adobe Acrobat DC) or some other methods.  
**This PDF tool provides not powerful, but simple alternative to that.**  
  
## Main Features  
  
- **Merge** : Currently supports 2-file merge. Will support multi-file merge soon.  
- **Extract** : Currently not supported. Will support extract page as pdf/image soon.
